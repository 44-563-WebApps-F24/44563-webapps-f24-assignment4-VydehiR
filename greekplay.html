                ’Tis Zeus, I tell thee, monarch of this isle,<br>
                Who thus hath willed. I am his minister.

                Wretch, what vile words thy wit hath power to say!<br>
                The gods are liars when invoked by thee.

                Nay, but the peer of noblest men, with whom<br>
                Thou art to take and ravage Troy with might.

                Never,—though I must suffer direst woe,—<br>
